# OKR:
#   The OKR files are related to my work experince as a technology manager for Our Kids Read. 
#   The bot searches through a Princeton database, retreives the information for the desired search,
#   and adds their information to a csv file (which is added to the OKR database via SQL).
#   For security reasons, the log in information has been replaced with "*" and the bot has been modified for example purposes.
#

#   The bot also includes features to:
#   - Email potential donors an user inputed message via outlook 
#   - Add the potential donor information to a excel sheet
#   - Add the potential donor information to a google sheet

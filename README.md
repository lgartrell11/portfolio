# OKR:
#   The OKR files are related to my work experince as a technology manager for Our Kids Read. 
#   The bot searches through a Princeton database, retreives the information for the desired search,
#   and adds their information to a csv file (which is added to the OKR database via SQL).
#   Because the log in information is private, it has been replaced with "*" for the purpose of this upload

#   The bot also includes features to:
#   - Email potential donors an user inputed message via outlook 
#   - Add the potential donor information to a excel sheet
#   - Add the potential donor information to a google sheet
